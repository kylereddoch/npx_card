# NPX CARD

This my NPX card unique style to connect with me directly via console or terminal.

Just type üëáüèº in your favorite terminal or console to connect with me.

```bash
npx kylereddoch
```

And get to know me in nerdy, unique style.

### I spent a consideral amount of effort (considering I hadn't played with node.js and npm too much) building and designing this iteration of npx card, and I am proud of it! All I ask of you all is, if you like it and use it, to put a **star** ‚≠ê on this project and fork it. Please do not claim this effort as your own ‚ô•.

#### STEPS TO CREATE YOUR OWN
